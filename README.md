# Ruby Space Invaders

This is a Space Invaders clone written in Ruby using the [Gosu framework](http://code.google.com/p/gosu/).

# Usage

    gem install gosu
    git clone git://github.com/llexileon/rubyinvaders.git
    cd rubyinvaders
    ./game.rb

# Controls

* Left & Right arrows to move
* Spacebar to fire
* Q to quit

# Resources

I've tried to implement the core mechanics of the game reasonably faithfully thus far, paying particular attention to the aliens movement behavior.

For more information, see the [Space Invaders wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_invaders).
